# Active-learning: Shaping rodent WM task performance
Whenever neuroscientists want to study the neural substrate of cognition, they first need to train animals to perform cognitive psychology tasks. Unfortunately, even tasks that a person could grasp after a 30 second verbal explanation, might take non-human animals several months to train. The goal of this project is to use deep reinforcement learning to model animal learning in a subset of memory tasks, and then conduct simulation experiments that might inform how to improve training time. 

## Goals 
* use deep reinforcement learning to model rodent learning on working memory tasks 
* use model to experiment with ways to improve training time.

## WIP notes
* investigating basic implementation assumptions
  - stimulus coding
  - reward structure
  - task implementation
* working on curriculum experiments 
  - pretrain on shorter delay
  - pretrain on less noisy stimuli
