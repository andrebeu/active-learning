# Active-learning: Shaping rodent WM task performance
Whenever neuroscientists want to study the neural substrate of cognition, they first need to train animals to perform cognitive psychology tasks. Unfortunately, even tasks that a person could grasp after a 30 second verbal explanation, might take non-human animals several months to train. The goal of this project is to use deep reinforcement learning to model animal learning in a subset of memory tasks, and then conduct simulation experiments that might inform how to improve training time. 

## improve training in rodent WM tasks [PWM task](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25510)
strategy: 
* model rodent learning with deep RL nets 
* use model to simulate different approaches to improving learning.
